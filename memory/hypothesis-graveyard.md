# Hypothesis Graveyard

Tested hypotheses and their evidence. "Graveyard" means the claim is no longer floating untested; it may be confirmed, refuted, inconclusive, or superseded.

Update rules:
- Move tested hypotheses here whether they succeed or fail.
- Include the test, evidence, decision, and linked idea when available.
- Prefer superseding or correcting old entries over leaving contradictory claims unresolved.

## Tested Hypotheses

### HYP-20260829-01: An asm-differ similarity score of 100 is sufficient evidence that an attempt is byte-exact.
- Status: Refuted
- Tested: 2026-08-29
- Test: Audit every attempt writer, match consumer, router, and near-miss selector; add explicit verifier receipts and adversarial score/verdict tests.
- Evidence: The oracle exposes exact separately; a 100-score relocation mismatch is possible. Before this change the attempts table discarded exact, matched/status inferred it from score, and six selectors excluded score-100 nonmatches. All 218 tests pass after fail-closed migration where historical rows remain NULL.
- Decision: Persist the verifier exact boolean on every new attempt; treat legacy rows as unknown; use score only for ranking and route score-100 nonmatches to relocation.
- Linked ideas: None
